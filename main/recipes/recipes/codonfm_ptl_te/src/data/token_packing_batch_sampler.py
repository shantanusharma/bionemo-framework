class TokenPackingBatchSampler:
    """Batch sampler that groups samples into batches bounded by a total token budget.

    Instead of a fixed number of samples per batch, this sampler accumulates samples until
    the total unpadded token count would exceed ``max_tokens_per_batch``.  This guarantees
    predictable peak memory in THD (packed) attention mode regardless of sequence-length
    distribution.

    The sampler requires the underlying dataset to expose a ``get_sequence_length(idx)``
    method that returns the unpadded token count for a given index **without** loading the
    full sample.

    Args:
        sampler: An iterable of dataset indices (e.g. ``DistributedSampler``).
        dataset: The dataset being sampled.  Must implement ``get_sequence_length(idx)``.
        max_tokens_per_batch: Upper bound on total unpadded tokens per batch.
        drop_last: If ``True`` (default), drop the final incomplete batch.
